= Tablature Organizer
This Python script organizes music tablature files by moving them into artist-specific folders.

== Features
- Automatically moves tablature files from the input directory into artist-named folders in the output directory.
- Supports filenames in the format: `Artist - Song.ext`
- Handles special formatting for artists whose names start with "The" (e.g., `The Beatles` becomes `Beatles, The`).
- Appends a timestamp to file names if a file already exists in the target folder.
